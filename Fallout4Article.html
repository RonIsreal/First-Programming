	<section id="Intro">
	<p>========================================</p>
	<p><h3>      Introduction</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>Hello everyone and welcome to the Sneak Master build guide. In this document I 
will share with you all what I think it’s a fairly overpowered build in 
Fallout 4 that will make the game a breeze for you. Breeze enough to make 
Survival looks easy in a certain stage of the game. Some might find it hard to 
believe me, especially the ones that didn’t play the game yet or have recently 
started, but trust me, it will!</p>

<p>REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A GLITCH/CHEAT FREE GUIDE! If you’re looking for this 
kind of information, please do not proceed.</p>

<p>I’ll try my best to keep this guide from spoiling your game, but I cannot 
guarantee this 100%. But don’t worry, the major events in the game will not be 
brought up.
Also in this guide I will not be discussing walkthroughs, quests, equipment, 
etc. I might mention a thing or two, but I won’t go deeper into these 
subjects.</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br>

	<!--Guide Use-->
	<section id="Usage">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>  What’s the use of this guide?</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>The reason why I created this guide was because after an extensive run through 
the game I have come up with a build that I find very entertaining while 
strong enough to allow you to deal with all kinds of situations while being 
exposed to the <i>least</i> amount of danger.</p>

<p>If you think this is something that might interest you then you’re in the 
right spot. I will guide you level by level, perk by perk and by the end of 
this guide you’ll be death itself. Legendary Deathclaws will be puppies for 
you.</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></section><br><br>

	<!--Seasoned Players-->
	<section id="Seasoned">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>    For the seasoned players</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>This is a small section just to enlighten a few crucial differences between 
the mechanisms of Fallout 4 and the previous versions. That doesn’t mean that 
first timers won’t see this section as useful. Any kind of information is good 
information.</p>

<p><u>One of the major changes in Fallout 4 is that you do not possess skills as you 
level</u>. Now it’s all about <b>Perks</b>. And I think this is a <i>positive change</i>.</p>

<p>Some other changes worth mentioning here are regarding S.P.E.C.I.A.L. 
attributes, but that I’ll explain in its own section.</p>

<p>There is no level cap anymore. Which means you can develop your character to 
your heart’s content. Each level you get one perk point which can be assigned 
either to perks itself or even to S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes, meaning you can 
have 10 points in all 7 attributes! Small note though, if you’re crazy enough 
and you’re considering having a fully developed character (all status 10 
points and all perks maxed), know that you’ll need a <b>level 268 character</b> in 
order to <u>max it all</u>. And I have already deducted the first 21 points the game 
gives you to create your starting build, the 7 Bobbleheads for each attribute 
and the extra 1 point from the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. book.</p>

<p>Perks now are per weapon type rather than ammo type. Meaning that if you have 
a Laser Sniper Rifle and a Ballistic Sniper Rifle, when you level a Sniper 
related perk, it’ll affect both of them. Nice!</p>

<p>Loot! Loot a lot! Loot everywhere! Resources are extremely necessary in this 
game, either for settlements’ development or armor/weapon crafting/modding.</p>

<p>Your companions can carry weight. And this is important if you choose to play 
with a companion. Since you don’t want to let go of that juicy loot because of 
overweight, you can simply handle them a portion of your load and still be 
able to walk. Make use of that if you choose to play with a companion.</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></section><br><br>

<!--SPECIAL-->
<section id="SPECIAL">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>         S.P.E.C.I.A.L</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>Ok, so this is the first crucial part of this entire guide and of course of 
the entire game. I’ll explain each attribute and how it’ll affect our build as 
to why put more points in this certain attribute rather than the other, etc. 
One important thing that I can’t stress enough is that you’ll need to get the 
Perception and Intelligence Bobbleheads as soon as possible. And I mean really 
soon. If you don’t know where they are, you can check many YouTube videos with 
guides as to where they are. Other than that, I suggest you follow this 
religiously if you want to create the build at its best, but of course it’s 
your game, your experience, so you can adjust to your play style. Anyway, 
let’s get to it. 
At the beginning of the game, you’ll have 21 points that needs to be assigned 
to your seven main attributes, known as S.P.E.C.I.A.L.</p>

<article><p><b>S.P.E.C.I.A.L</b> stands for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, 
Intelligence, Agility and Luck. Their effects are:</p>

<p><strong><u>- Strength</u></strong></p>

<p>This attribute is mainly needed for Melee based characters (not our case) 
since it gives you a 10% damage increase in hand-to-hand combat (including 
batons, swords, knives, etc.). It also increases by 10 points your weight 
carrying capacity.</p>

<p>For this attribute we’ll assign only <b>2 POINTS</b>, since the only Perk we’ll need 
from here is the Armorer perk which will be available after you collect the 
Strength Bobblehead.</p><br>

<p><strong><u>- Perception</u></strong></p>

<p>This attribute affects your V.A.T.S. accuracy, lock picking and stealing 
attempts. Some will say that you need many points because of the things that 
it affects, but in all honesty, V.A.T.S. will be barely used by us and 
stealing will still be easy. Lock picking will be a bit more challenging, yes, 
but you can compensate it with Magazines that increase your lock picking 
skills and the Bobblehead.</p>

<p>For this attribute we’ll assign only <b>3 POINTS</b>. <i>But one thing I want to remind 
you all here is that it’s imperative to collect the Perception Bobblehead as 
soon as you can</i>, since only with it you’ll have access to the Locksmith perk, 
which is extremely important. The other skill we’ll want to have from this 
tree is Rifleman and Awareness (this one especially for the first timers).</p><br>

<p><strong><u>- Endurance</u></strong></p>

<p>This attribute affects the amount of Hit Points (HP), also known as life, 
you’ll have as well as the Action Points (AP) depletion while sprinting. Since 
in our build we’ll be looking for the kill before our enemies spot us and IF 
they do, you’ll be far away to sprint only enough until you break their line 
of sight, this is not a requirement for us. Because of the lack of points in 
this attribute, the beginning of the game can be quite challenging for some, 
but it’ll worth your while later. I promise.

<p>For this attribute we’ll assign <b>NO POINTS AT ALL</b>, <u>leaving us only with the 1 
point that you already have</u>. Also the perk you have access to, Toughness, can 
be interesting but later on only. I’ll get into that later on in this guide.</p><br>

<p><strong><u>- Charisma</u></strong></p>

<p>This attribute affects your chances of persuading others in dialogues, 
buying/selling and the amount of people you can have in your settlements. I 
particularly find this perk important because you’ll face many decisions in 
the game where a good dialogue can be very profitable. Also some perks are 
needed here, especially if you choose to play with a companion. I’ll explain 
it later.</p>

<p>For this attribute we’ll assign <b>7 POINTS</b>, since with the Bobblehead you’ll 
have access to the Inspirational perk, in case you choose to take a companion 
with you. If not then all good too. The high charisma will help you a lot in 
bartering and all the dialogues, which you’ll find to be plenty in this game. 
The other perks we’ll want to level from this tree are Lady Killer/Black 
Widow, Lone Wanderer and Local Leader (the first level at least). If later on 
you feel like it, you can level Inspirational and/or Attack Dog perks.</p><br>

<p><strong><u>- Intelligence</u></strong></p>

<p>This attribute affects the amount of experience you get from your actions. 
This is a fairly good status but unfortunately we don’t have points to spare, 
besides all the interesting perks from this tree will be available when we 
fetch its Bobblehead. So this one is another Bobblehead we’ll want to get at 
our earliest convenience. A bit troublesome at the very beginning, but nothing 
impossible.</p>

<p>For this attribute we’ll assign <b>5 POINTS</b>, giving us access to Gun Nut, Hacker 
and Scrapper perks. After we fetch the Bobblehead we’ll be able to access 
Science! perk, which is a must.</p><br>

<p><strong><u>- Agility (our core attribute)</u></strong></p>

<p>This attribute affects the amount of Action Points you’ll have in V.A.T.S. and 
your ability to sneak. Here’s our main attribute even though we won’t rely 
much on V.A.T.S, we’ll sneak a lot. And I mean A LOT!
<p>For this attribute we’ll assign a hefty <b>8 POINTS</b> and we’ll want to max it as 
soon as possible! If you’re asking <i>“why not 10 points then?”</i>, I’ll explain 
now. 8 points assigned, one from the Bobblehead and another one from the 
S.P.E.C.I.A.L. book. 10 points!</p>

<p>Here we’ll have many perks that we’re interested in leveling, such as 
Gunslinger, Sneak, Mister Sandman, Ninja, Gun Fu, and depending even Action 
Boy/Girl and Quick Hands (this one only one point if chosen at all).</p><br>

<p><strong><u>- Luck</u></strong></p>

<p>This attribute affects the odds of finding more stuff at crates (ammo, caps, 
etc.) and the recharge rate of your critical meter. Though critical hits are 
great, we won’t be using them much.</p>

<p>For this attribute we’ll assign only <b>2 POINTS</b>, and after we get the Bobblehead 
we’ll be able to access the Bloody Mess perk, which is the one we’re looking 
for.</p>

<p>Ok, so that was a lot so far, but let’s recap the point distribution only:</p>
<section id="table">
<p><b>S – 2</b></p>
<p><b>P – 3</b></p>
<p><b>E – 1</b></p>
<p><b>C – 7</b></p>
<p><b>I – 5</b></p>
<p><b>A – 8</b></p>
<p><b>L – 2</b></p></section>
<p><u>Remember that you must get the Perception and Intelligence Bobbleheads as soon 
as possible!</u></p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></article></section>

<!--Perks-->
<section id="Perks">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>            Perks</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>


<p>In this part I’ll explain the effects of each perk, why I chose them and 
how far should we level them. Remember, that a wasted point is a whole new 
level you’ll need to get in order to recover it. So pay close attention. I’ll 
detail them each by Tree so it’s easier for you to find, but remember, I’ll be 
listing a couple of perks here that are not that pertinent to us, but could be 
later in the game. So whatever you read here, use it as information but when 
to level each, please read the next sessions, since it’s where I’ll be going 
into details.<p>

<p><strong><u>- Strength Tree</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Armorer (Strength Level 3)</b>: This perk allows you to craft/modify your armors. 
This is important to us since you can modify your power armor (not that you’ll 
use it, but it’s sweet to have a fully maxed one at your disposal) and your 
regular armors and combat armors (this one is my personal choice). This perk 
you’ll want to max it.</li><br></ul>

<p><strong><u>- Perception Tree</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rifleman (Perception Level 2)</b>: Each level of this perk increases by 20% the 
damage inflicted with non-automatic rifles. Also from level 2 on it starts 
ignoring the enemies’ armor, which is great since you’ll find many enemies 
wearing armors. The amount it starts ignoring is 15% at level 2, 20% at level 
3, 25% at level 4 and 30% at level five. Also from level 4 you’ll start having 
a chance of crippling a limb from your enemy. At level 5 this chance is 
augmented. This perk you’ll want to max it.</li>

<li><b>Awareness (Perception Level 3)</b>: This perk has only one level and it mainly 
helps you determine which kind of weapon will deal the most damage to your 
enemy. If this is your first run in the game, it’s helpful since it’ll help 
you save ammo, which you’ll find it to be important. If you already know that 
you shouldn’t try radiation damage on a ghoul, duh, you don’t need this perk 
and can even place it in the Perception attribute itself to save you the 
hassle of early hunting the Bobblehead and getting the Locksmith perk 
available.</li>

<li><b>Locksmith (Perception Level 4)</b>: This perk allows you to pick harder locks. At 
level 1 you’ll be able to pick Advanced locks, at level 2 you’ll be able to 
pick Expert locks and at level 3 you’ll be able to pick Master locks. At level 
4 you’ll be able to pick locks without breaking the bobby pin. Though this 
looks great, it’s a waste of point, since you’ll have more than enough bobby 
pins at your disposal later on in the game when this level becomes available. 
So for this perk you’ll level it only up to level 3.</li></ul><br>

<p><strong><u>- Endurance Tree</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Toughness (Endurance Level 1)</b>: Each level of this perk gives you an extra 10 
points of damage resistance. You don’t need it at all, but very later on in 
the game, if you choose to level your character even further than needed, then 
you can maximize it. But it is irrelevant for us.</li></ul><br>

<p><strong><u>- Charisma Tree</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lady Killer/Black Widow (Charisma Level 2)</b>: The opposite sex of yours will 
suffer 5% extra damage per level and will be easier to persuade in dialogues. 
This perk also makes it easier to use the Intimidation Perk, but this is far 
from available to us. Besides, we won’t be getting close enough to them to 
actually need this perk. So for this perk you can max it.</li>

<li><b>Lone Wanderer (Charisma Level 3)</b>: This perk has different effects and all 
interesting for us. What’s worth mentioning here is that this perk is only 
active when travelling without a companion. So if you took a brother/sister in 
arms, this perk is inactive for the time being. On the first level of this 
perk you’ll suffer 15% less damage and will gain an increase of 50 for your 
weight carrying capacity. On the second level, your damage resistance will 
double to 30% and so will your weight carrying capacity, jumping to a great 
100. The third level will grant you the first 2 level’s abilities and will 
also now boost your damage by 25%. So for this perk you’ll want to max it.</li>

<li><b>Local Leader (Charisma Level 6)</b>: On the first level of this perk, you’ll be 
able to establish supply lines between your settlements. And this is important 
because they will be able to share supplies, saving you the hassle of farming 
twice for 2 settlements. The second level allows you to build stores and 
workstations in your settlements. However, for this perk we’re only interested 
in the first level, so one point here is enough.</li>

<li><b>Inspirational (Charisma Level 8)</b>: This perk is relevant for your companions 
only. Each level grants a different bonus. On the first level, your companion 
has increased damage and cannot hurt you (grenades, etc.). On the second level 
your companion has increased damage resistance and won’t be hurt by your 
attacks (but you can still nuke yourself). On the third level, your companion 
can carry more items. I mentioned this perk in case you want to play with 
companions, but remember, if you take one, Lone Wanderer won’t be active. So 
you must scale it and see what’s better for you. I prefer going alone, but 
then again, your call.</li></ul><br>

<p><strong><u>- Intelligence Tree</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gun Nut (Intelligence Level 3)</b>: This perk allows you to modify your guns. 
You’ll realize that modding your guns is essential to the game so you’ll want 
to do it as much as you can. For this perk we’ll max it.</li>

<li><b>Hacker (Intelligence Level 4)</b>: This perk is pretty similar to Locksmith, 
except that you’ll be hacking terminals. And just like Locksmith, you’ll want 
to level it only until you can hack Master terminals. The last level also 
seems interesting, but completely irrelevant, since you can always reset the 
hacking if you miss your first 3 attempts by leaving the terminal and 
accessing it again. So you’ll never be locked out of a terminal unless you 
want to.</li>

<li><b>Scrapper (Intelligence Level 5)</b>: Some people find this perk not interesting 
enough, I find it essential. The material you’re able to scrap from irrelevant 
guns is amazing. So this perk we’ll max it as well.</li>

<li><b>Science! (Intelligence Level 6)</b>: This perk allows you to use high-tech 
modifications. These mods are for both weapon and armor, so this perk is a 
must. We’ll certainly max it too.</li>

<li><b>Medic (Intelligence Level 2)</b>: Increases the effects of Stimpacks and RadAways 
per level. On level 1, it increases to 40% HP recovery and 40% radiation 
removal. On level 2 it increases another 20%. On level 3 another 20% (summing 
80% by now) and on level 4 it fully recovers your HP and removes all radiation 
damage, as well as an increase on the speed of healing. This perk is not 
needed while playing the game but if you choose to play the game further than 
what’s “required”, you can level it to max.</li></ul><br>

<p><strong><u>- Agility Tree (Where most of our points will go)</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gunslinger (Agility Level 1)</b>: Same as Rifleman, except that instead of 
ignoring the enemy’s armor, you’ll gain range. This perk will be maxed.</li>

<li><b>Sneak (Agility Level 3)</b>: <i>The most important perk of the tree along with Ninja.</i> 
This one is what makes us great. Sneak is interesting because on the first 
level it already increases by 20% your stealth abilities. On the second level 
it increases another 10% but also <u>prevents you from triggering floor-based 
traps</u>. You’ll still trigger mines though. On the third level however, not only 
you’ll get another 10% increase on your sneaking ability, <u>but also mines are 
no longer triggered</u>, so you don’t have to worry anymore about where you’re 
stepping. On the fourth level, another 10% increase but now you can run! And 
the last level is interesting because if you get spotted by afar (which 
happens), crouching will make them lose sight of you. So this perk will be 
maxed obviously.</li>

<li><b>Mister Sandman (Agility Level 4)</b>: This perk increases the damage with silenced 
weapons (and we’ll be using them all the time) while sneaking. Also if you 
encounter a sleeping enemy, with this perk you’ll instantly kill him. So we’ll 
max this perk as well.</li>

<li><b>Ninja (Agility Level 7)</b>: This perk increases your sneak attacks. On level 1, 
you’ll get a 2.5x damage increase with ranged weapons and 4x increase with 
melee. On level 2 these numbers jump to 3x and 5x respectively and on level 3 
they jump to 3.5x and 10x. Though the melee increase looks good here what 
we’re interested in is the ranged increase, so we’ll max this perk too.</li>

<li><b>Gun Fu (Agility Level 10)</b>: This is a V.A.T.S. related perk. I know I said we 
won’t be relying on V.A.T.S., but in close encounters or small places packed 
with enemies, this skill will come in handy. Its effect is an increase of 25% 
damage on to your second target and beyond while in V.A.T.S. on level 1, 50% 
more damage on your third target and beyond on level 2 and instant critical 
hits on your fourth target and beyond on level 3. Killer!</li>

<li><b>Action Boy/Girl (Agility Level 5)</b>: This perk regenerates your Action Points 
faster. Action Points are spent while running or while using V.A.T.S. On level 
1 it regenerates 25% faster and on level 2 it regenerates 50% faster. I 
mentioned this perk just now because this is a perk you can level after you 
leveled the ones I mentioned as needed, therefore leading you to level your 
character beyond what’s needed.</li>

<li><b>Quick Hands (Agility Level 8)</b>: This perk allows you to reload your guns faster 
and when maxed while reloading on V.A.T.S. you won’t spend Action Points. I’d 
say that later on in the game you can level it once. The V.A.T.S. advantage 
doesn’t look too advantageous.</li></ul><br>

<p><strong><u>- Luck Tree</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bloody Mess (Luck Level 3)</b>: Chance of exploding your enemies into a red gory 
paste and 5% damage increase per level up to level 3, since on level 4 instead 
of increasing the damage by another 5%, all nearby enemies have a chance of 
exploding as well. Which is nice when it happens. Saves ammo and gives you a 
sense of awesomeness.</li></ul><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></section>

<!--Leveling Part-->
<section id="Leveling">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>          Leveling</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>Now this is where the fun starts, <i>and I’m not being ironic</i>! Remember that <b>all</b> 
your actions net you experience (finding new locations, crafting, combat, 
quests, etc.), so do a lot! Run around, kill stuff that you can kill, loot a 
lot to craft things and get experience points and try to do as many side 
quests as possible! You’ll notice that some side quests are infinite, so you 
can take them on as much as you want. They are a good source of experience 
points.</p>

<p>A few pointers here. I know that this game has no level cap, but I established 
a “maximum level” as level 50 because that’s the requirement to open the last 
upgrade for level 10 perks of any attribute. So I’ll make the guide all the 
way up to level 50 and consider there as a maximum character, but don’t worry, 
I’ll also go after the “maximum level” in case someone (like me) wants to hone 
its character. I think that between level 70 and 75 is the perfect character. 
You can keep leveling even more, but know that with time and as you go through 
the storyline, the amount of side quests you can take will drastically drop, 
so leveling will be harder and harder. Without further talking, let’s get to 
it!</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></section>

<section id="First10">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>      The First Ten Levels</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>Ok, so you’re fresh off the Vault and ready to tackle the vast world that 
Commonwealth is, but hold on. If you start running around like crazy, you’ll 
just get destroyed. For now, go only to Concord as the game prompts you (and 
make sure you grab the Perception Bobblehead) and then fetch the Intelligence 
Bobblehead. I’ll warn you that it’ll be hard to get it because of your lack of 
equipment, but with patience you’ll succeed. Also let the enemies kill each 
other in the premises, that’s the best tip I can give you. For the first ten 
levels, you’ll want to level the following perks in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 2: Scrapper (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 3: Awareness (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 4: Hacker 1 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 5: Locksmith 1 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 6: Gun Nut 1 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 7: Science! 1 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 8: Sneak 1 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 9: Locksmith 2 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 10: Sneak 2 (Agility);</li></ul>

<p>As you noticed, you didn’t get many skills that will influence directly in 
your combat, so the game will still be tough for you. However we’re building a 
base here by enabling you to have access to better equipment and loot. Not to 
mention that your sneaking skills are being developed. By now you’re able to 
get closer to your enemies without being detected most of the times (crouching works wonders), and you can also open most of the locked 
containers around you and hack most of the terminals.</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></section>

<section id="Next10">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>      The Next Ten Levels</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>Things now will start getting interesting since <i>we’ll be seeing clear 
improvements to our character</i>. Enemies are getting a bit tougher with the 
increase of legendary foes, but with that comes better loot. If you’re 
playing with a companion, now is the time to get the Charisma Bobblehead. For 
us in order to keep the momentum going, we’ll level the following perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 11: Ninja 1 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 12: Sneak 3 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 13: Gun Nut 2 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 14: Lady Killer/Black Widow 1 (Charisma);</li>
<li>Level 15: Hacker 2 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 16: Ninja 2 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 17: Science! 2 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 18: Locksmith 3 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 19: Lone Wanderer 1 or Inspirational 1 (Charisma);</li>
<li>Level 20: Lady Killer/Black Widow 2 (Charisma);</li></ul>

<p>In this stage of the game, you can sneak quite well, you don’t have to worry 
about looking where you’re walking anymore, your damage is building up nicely 
with the perks and stronger items and you can even take a small beating if it 
happens. You probably already built a sniper rifle, so your sneak headshots 
are draining at least one third of your enemies’ HP. But let’s start 
destroying the game now.</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></section>

<section id="Other10">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>      The Other Ten Levels</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>Here is where we’ll boost our damage and will start getting bold. We’ll face 
more enemies at once, we’ll be able to even get closer to them and we’ll 
finally be able to put silencer and fully develop most of our weapons, so that 
will be a game changer for us. Here’s how you should proceed with the next ten 
levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 21: Hacker 3 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 22: Lady Killer/Black Widow 3 (Charisma);</li>
<li>Level 23: Sneak 4 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 24: Scrapper 2 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 25: Gun Nut 3 (Agility) – <b>SILENCER BABY!</b></li>
<li>Level 26: Mister Sandman 1 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 27: Lone Wanderer 2 or Inspirational 2 (Charisma);</li>
<li>Level 28: Science! 3 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 29: Mister Sandman 2 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 30: Mister Sandman 3 (Agility);</li></ul>

<p>By now you are already sneaky enough to kill most enemies without ever being 
detected so your enemies are just unaware preys waiting to be slain. Don’t let 
it get to your head though, you are still frail if you get caught since you 
don’t have much HP and your armors are still weak. We’ll take care of that 
though. I advise you to grab Luck Bobblehead now if you haven’t yet. It’ll be 
needed from now on.</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></section>

<section id="More10">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>      More Ten Levels</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>Here things get personal. <u>You’ll have to choose according more to your game 
style, which you have defined by now</u>. I’m saying that because you’ll have to 
choose <u>between Rifleman or Gunslinger</u> according to the weapon you’re using 
most. I noticed that I was using pistols a lot more than sniper rifles so 
I went for the Gunslinger perk but then again, no harm if you choose Rifleman 
instead. Also if you still didn’t get the Strength Bobblehead, now’s the time. 
Here’s how the next ten levels should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 31: Bloody Mess 1 (Luck);</li>
<li>Level 32: Bloody Mess 2 (Luck);</li>
<li>Level 33: Ninja 3 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 34: Armorer 1 (Strength);</li>
<li>Level 35: Gunslinger 1 (Agility) or Rifleman 1 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 36: Armorer 2 (Strength);</li>
<li>Level 37: Gunslinger 2 (Agility) or Rifleman 2 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 38: Sneak 5 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 39: Gun Nut 4 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 40: Gunslinger 3 (Agility) or Rifleman 3 (Perception);</li></ul>

<p>By now the game is a breeze. You’re playing on Survival mode, you’re killing 
everything with ease and the legendary loot is filling your inventory. Nice! 
But we’re still not there! Now you’ll need the Agility Bobblehead. Also if you 
want to fetch the Endurance one as well, why not? It won’t change much but at 
least it’s one less Bobblehead!</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></section>

<section id="Last10">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>      The “Last” Ten Levels</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>Since you already have a fairly decent damage and you can sneak easily, we’ll 
focus now on our protection and make death fear you. I assume you already 
picked all Bobbleheads by now if you’re following this guide properly. If you 
didn’t, go get them and then keep following! Here’s how the “last” ten levels 
should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 41: Science! 4 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 42: Bloody Mess 3 (Luck);</li>
<li>Level 43: Local Leader 1 (Charisma);</li>
<li>Level 44: Armorer 3 (Strength);</li>
<li>Level 45: Gun Fu 1 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 46: Gun Fu 2 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 47: Armorer 4 (Strength);</li>
<li>Level 48: Lone Wanderer 3 or Inspirational 3 (Charisma);</li>
<li>Level 49: Bloody Mess 4 (Luck);</li>
<li>Level 50: Gun Fu 3 (Agility);</li></ul>

<p>That’s it, you’re now a death god! Survival mode is the same as Easy mode and 
you’re a monster. You broke the game. Nothing they can throw your way can put 
you in trouble. If you are satisfied with your character the way it is, then 
great! You can do everything in the game and feel accomplished by it. You have 
conquered the Commonwealth. However, if you feel there’s still room for 
improvement or if you want to crush everything in your way and be the ruler of 
Fallout, the next session is where you’ll go even further in your character’s 
development.</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></section>

<section id="Beyond">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>      More Levels and Beyond</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>So it’s not enough to crash the game, you have to turn it into dust! Ok, I dig 
you! I did that too! So let’s show them who's boss. The true legendary 
one! From here on it’s up to you how you would like to level your character. 
You possess by now a great notion of the game and if you’re still following my 
guide it’s only because you’re trying to make me happy. I appreciate it! From 
now on I suggest you level your character this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 51: Gunslinger 4 (Agility) or Rifleman 4 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 52: Gunslinger 5 (Agility) or Rifleman 5 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 53: Quick Hands 1 (Agility);</li></ul>

<p>From level 54 until level 58 you’ll maximize the perk you didn’t choose when 
you had to choose between Gunslinger and Rifleman:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 54: Gunslinger 1 (Agility) or Rifleman 1 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 55: Gunslinger 2 (Agility) or Rifleman 2 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 56: Gunslinger 3 (Agility) or Rifleman 3 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 57: Gunslinger 4 (Agility) or Rifleman 4 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 58: Gunslinger 5 (Agility) or Rifleman 5 (Perception);</li>
<li>Level 59: Action Boy/Girl 1 (Agility);</li>
<li>Level 60: Action Boy/Girl 2 (Agility);</li></ul>

<p>Here you can choose between Medic or Toughness and max it. I’d go for Medic 
first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 61: Medic 1 (Intelligence) or Toughness 1 (Endurance);</li>
<li>Level 62: Medic 2 (Intelligence) or Toughness 2 (Endurance);</li>
<li>Level 63: Medic 3 (Intelligence) or Toughness 3 (Endurance);</li>
<li>Level 64: Medic 4 (Intelligence) or Toughness 4 (Endurance);</li>
<li>Level 65: Toughness 1 (Endurance) or Toughness 5 (Endurance);</li>
<li>Level 66: Toughness 2 (Endurance) or Medic 1 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 67: Toughness 3 (Endurance) or Medic 2 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 68: Toughness 4 (Endurance) or Medic 3 (Intelligence);</li>
<li>Level 69: Toughness 5 (Endurance) or Medic 4 (Intelligence);</li></ul>

<p>Now if you want to <strong>really</strong> gloat about your character, why not level 
Attack Dog perk? I don’t know if it’s a flaw in the game or not, but having 
Dogmeat as companion doesn’t cancel the effects of Lone Wanderer, so you can 
combo his perk with yours. Overkill!</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 70: Attack Dog 1 (Charisma);</li>
<li>Level 71: Attack Dog 2 (Charisma);</li>
<li>Level 72: Attack Dog 3 (Charisma);</li></ul>

<p>And this is as far as I go! If you want to go even further, then let me know 
what you did!</p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br> </section>

<section id="Tips">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>            Tips</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>Here I’ll just share a couple of tips that I think it’ll help you all through 
your journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogmeat is a great companion. He doesn’t cancel the effects of the Lone 
Wanderer perk and can carry stuff!</li>

<li>Spare Outfits: Always bring with you outfits that boosts your Charisma. They 
can help you a lot when bartering, delivering quests and in dialogues. Also 
always walk with a Hazmat Suit in your inventory as well. You’ll never know 
when things will go nuclear on you;</li>

<li>If you find a legendary rifle (Hunting or Sniper) with the Instigating title 
on it, GET IT! The Instigating effect deals double damage when enemies are at 
full health. Since you’ll sneak a lot on them and 99% of the time they are 
fully healed, you’ll be able to 1-shot kill most of your enemies.</li>

<li>Keep the “Deliverer” pistol with you at all times. This is a legendary 
pistol you’ll get as you progress through the storyline. It is simply THE 
pistol to have with our build;</li>

<li>Explosive effects are awesome, especially for Combat Shotguns and Miniguns. 
So if you’re lucky enough to find one of these, keep it;</li>

<li>Mighty and Violent effects are good overall for any legendary weapon. They 
grant you a 25% damage increase and the Violent even has a chance to cripple, 
though it comes with a huge recoil;</li>

<li>Chameleon effect is good for you only when you’re <u>standing still</u> (while 
sniping for example), so if you want better sneaking equipment, go for the 
<i>Cunning</i> prefix, since it increases your AGI and PER by 1 point each;</li></ul><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></section>

<section id="FAQ">
<p>========================================</p>
<p><h3>    Frequently Asked Questions</h3></p>
<p>========================================</p>

<p>This is a small session I’ll be updating as I receive more and more questions 
which I’ll share <i>IF</i> pertinent. Who knows, your question can also be someone 
else’s. Sometimes it can be an affirmation rather than a question, but I’ll 
answer anyway.</p>

<p>Q: <b>“He sees that there are several different start builds and show them all as 
viable options”.</b></p>

<p>A: <i>I don’t think there are several start builds. The only choices I am giving 
you are whether you’d like to play with a companion or alone. And even if you 
choose to play alone, I am suggesting you spend your points as if you’d play 
with a companion (putting the extra 2 points on Charisma instead of any other 
attribute). As for the “choice” between leveling Gunslinger or Rifleman perk 
first (I put “” in choice because later on in the game this decision can be 
pretty much irrelevant), this is something you’ll know what to do as you 
develop your gaming style. So it’s not really a choice, it’ll be more of a 
reflection of how you’re playing. Still, if you feel like these are choices, 
this guide still gives you the guidelines on what to do regardless of your 
decision.</i></p>

<p>Q: <b>“Why would you suggest taking any S.P.E.C.I.A.L Bobbleheads before reaching 
level 10 first? Why settle for 10 when you could have 11”?</b></p>

<p>A: <i>I start by asking, Why wait until level 10? Why not level 5? Why not level 
20? Fallout is a game that gives you autonomy to do what you want whenever you 
want. Yes, of course that some places will destroy you in a blink of an eye, 
but hey, the game didn’t say you couldn’t go there. Besides, the first two 
Bobbleheads I’m encouraging you to fetch are fairly easy compared to others. 
The Perception Bobblehead you’ll stumble on it whether you like it or not at 
the very early stages of the game when you reach Concord. The Intelligence 
one, which is a bit harder, you’ll find not far from Concord, next to 
Cambridge Police Station. Yes, the place is a bit hard with all the turrets, 
protectrons, traps and super mutants, but if you completed the first mission 
and got the Perception Bobblehead, you already have a Power Armor at your 
disposal, so that pretty much helps you get through it. I did it without the 
Power Armor relying more on sneaking, and I got into a combat situation only 
once.</p>

<p>Now as to why settle with 10 when you could have 11, I ask again, why settle 
with 11 when you could have 12? Or 15? Or 20? Or 100? As you probably noticed 
already, the perks go only up to level 10, so that should be the first 
indicator. The second reason is also because with equipment you’ll find later 
in the game, you’ll sneak easily with mediocre armor. So anything beyond level 
10 would be a waste. But if you want to level beyond what I suggested, have 
fun. I’ll consider 10 as the maximum points you should spend in any attribute, 
since beyond that you can just use consumables and specific stat increase 
armors. So why settle for 10? Because 10 is enough.</p></i><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br></section>
