// Exercise 1: HTML is Hypertext MarkUp Language, which is a language used to build websites using tags. PHP is HyperText Processor, which is a language that used to create dynamic webpages inside the HTML. While HTML is a Client Side language, PHP is a Server Side language and most of the information in it are pertinent to the server, therefore it isn't processed on the user's computer, rather on the server side through requests.

//Exercise 2: 

$addressNumber = 67;
$addressStreet = 'Herzl St.';
$country = 'Israel';
$globalAddress = "I live in ".$addressStreet.", ".$addressNumber." in ".$country"."
echo $globalAddress;

echo "In ".$country." many streets have the same name! For example, ".$addressStreet." can be found in Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan!";

//Exercise 3:

$pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'rabbit', 'cow'];

echo $pets[2];

//Exercises 4 and 5:

$myAddress = [

"country" => $country,
"city" => "Ramat Gan",
"street" => $addressStreet,
"streetNumber" => $addressNumber,
"favouriteFood" => ["strogonoff", "cheeseburger", "chocolate"]
]; 

//Exercise 6:

echo $myAddress[4]["favouriteFood"]

echo "Ronny lives in ".$myAddress[1]["city"]." on ".$myAddress[2]["street"].", ".$myAddress[3]["streetNumber"]." - ".$myAddress[0]["country"].". <br> His favourite foods are: ".$myAddress[4]["favouriteFood"].".";
